    <h2>Wind Mills</h2>
    <div class="wind">Wind power or wind energy describes the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic
         energy in the wind into mechanical power.
        <br>
        A windmill is a structure that converts wind power into rotational energy using vanes called sails or blades, by tradition specifically to mill grain (gristmills), but in some parts of the English-speaking world the term has also been extended to encompass windpumps, wind turbines, and other applications. The term wind engine is also sometimes used to describe such devices.[failed verification]
             <br>
        Windmills were used throughout the high medieval and early modern periods; the horizontal or panemone windmill first appeared in Persia during the 9th century, and the vertical windmill first appeared in northwestern Europe in the 12th century. Regarded as an icon of Dutch culture, there are approximately 1,000 windmills in the Netherlands today.
        <br>
        Wind turbines are the modern version of a windmill. Put simply, they use the power of the wind to create electricity. Large wind turbines are the most visible, but you can also buy a small wind turbine for individual use; for example to provide power to a caravan or boat.

        windmill, device for tapping the energy of the wind by means of sails mounted on a rotating shaft. The sails are mounted at an angle or are given a slight twist so that the force of wind against them is divided into two components, one of which, in the plane of the sails, imparts rotation. windmill.
